Linked lists are fundamental data structures that store data in nodes, where each node points to another. Two popular variants are the **singly linked list** and the **doubly linked list**. While both are linear data structures, they differ in their node structure and operational efficiencies.

---

## 1. Node Structure

### Singly Linked List
- **Components:**  
  - **Data:** The value stored in the node.  
  - **Next Pointer:** A reference to the next node.
- **Traversal:**  
  - Can only be traversed in the forward direction.
- **Memory Usage:**  
  - Requires less memory per node since only one pointer is stored.

### Doubly Linked List
- **Components:**  
  - **Data:** The value stored in the node.  
  - **Next Pointer:** A reference to the next node.  
  - **Previous Pointer:** A reference to the previous node.
- **Traversal:**  
  - Can be traversed in both forward and backward directions.
- **Memory Usage:**  
  - Requires more memory per node (approximately twice the pointer overhead).

## 2. Core Operations & Their Complexities

| **Operation**                         | **Singly Linked List**                       | **Doubly Linked List**                         |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Insertion at Beginning**            | O(1) — Simply update head pointer.           | O(1) — Update head pointer; set `prev` to null. |
| **Insertion at End**                | O(n) — Must traverse entire list if no tail pointer is maintained.  | O(1) — Can be O(1) if tail pointer is maintained; otherwise, O(n) if traversal is needed. |
| **Insertion at Arbitrary Position**   | O(n) — Generally requires traversal to the node's predecessor. | O(1) — If pointer/reference to target node is given (can insert before or after in constant time). Otherwise, searching is still O(n). |
| **Deletion by Value (with search)**   | O(n) — Need to traverse to locate the node and its predecessor. | O(n) — Searching is O(n); however, once a pointer to the node is available, deletion is O(1) as both previous and next pointers are directly accessible. |
| **Search**                            | O(n) — Must traverse sequentially.           | O(n) — Same worst-case, but can sometimes optimize by starting from head or tail (if index is near either end). |
| **Traversal**                         | O(n) — Only forward traversal.                | O(n) — Supports both forward and backward traversal. |

### Key Points:
- **Insertion/Deletion When Pointer Is Known:**  
  - In a **doubly linked list**, if you already have a pointer to the node to be deleted (or its neighbor for insertion), you can update the links in constant time, O(1).  
  - In a **singly linked list**, even with a pointer to the node, deletion often requires finding the predecessor node, which takes O(n) time in the worst case.
- **Memory Overhead:**  
  - Doubly linked lists consume more memory per node due to the extra pointer.
- **Directional Traversal:**  
  - Doubly linked lists allow bidirectional traversal, which can be advantageous in certain applications like browser navigation or implementing certain algorithms.

## 3. When to Use Which?

- **Singly Linked Lists:**
  - **Pros:** Simpler, lower memory overhead, easier to implement.
  - **Use Cases:** Ideal for stacks, simple queues, and applications where only forward traversal is needed.
- **Doubly Linked Lists:**
  - **Pros:** Allow O(1) deletion and insertion at arbitrary positions (if node pointer is given), support bidirectional traversal.
  - **Use Cases:** Suitable for implementing deques (double-ended queues), browser history (back and forth navigation), LRU caches, and text editors where undo/redo functionality is needed.

## 4. Code Comparison (Optional)

While the primary focus here is on conceptual differences and complexities, you can refer to detailed code examples in the previous section on **Singly Linked Lists 101** (for singly linked list code) and a similar guide for doubly linked lists. The key difference in code is that each node in a doubly linked list contains an extra pointer (commonly named `prev`) and that operations update both `next` and `prev` pointers.

**Example: Deletion in Doubly Linked List (C++):**
```cpp
void deleteNode(Node* node) {
    // Assumes node is not null and is part of a doubly linked list
    if (node->prev != nullptr)
        node->prev->next = node->next;
    if (node->next != nullptr)
        node->next->prev = node->prev;
    // Now safely delete node (or free memory)
    delete node;
}
```
This deletion operation is **O(1)** when a pointer to the node is available.

---

## 5. Summary

- **Singly linked lists** are simpler and use less memory but can be less efficient for deletion or insertion at arbitrary positions because you often must traverse the list to find a node’s predecessor.
- **Doubly linked lists** use more memory (due to an extra pointer per node) but allow constant-time deletion and insertion (given a pointer) and offer bidirectional traversal.
- The choice between the two depends on the application requirements regarding memory usage, operation efficiency, and traversal direction.

By understanding these differences and their associated time and space complexities, you can make informed decisions about which linked list variant best suits your application.

Happy coding!
